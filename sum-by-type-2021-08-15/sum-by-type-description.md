You have a list. Each value from that list can be either a string or an integer. Your task here is to return two values. The first one is a concatenation of all strings from the given list. The second one is a sum of all integers from the given list.

**Input:** An array of strings and integers

**Output:** A list or tuple

**Example:**

```python
sum_by_types([]) == ['', 0]
sum_by_types([1, 2, 3]) == ['', 6]
sum_by_types(['1', 2, 3]) == ['1', 5]
sum_by_types(['1', '2', 3]) == ['12', 3]
sum_by_types(['1', '2', '3']) == ['123', 0]
sum_by_types(['size', 12, 'in', 45, 0]) == ['sizein', 57]
```

**How itâ€™s used:** *(math is used everywhere)*

**Precondition:** *both given ints should be between -1000 and 1000*
